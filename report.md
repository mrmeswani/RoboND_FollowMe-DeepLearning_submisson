## Deep Learning Project ##

The goal of this project, is to train a deep neural network to identify and track a target in simulation. In real world, “follow me” applications like this are key to many fields of robotics and the very same techniques applied here could be extended to scenarios like advanced cruise control in autonomous vehicles or human-robot collaboration in industry.

## Requirements
### Write up requirements
* Include N/W architecture diagram for reference of the reviewer.
* The write-up conveys an understanding of the network architecture. Explain the role of each layer. Justify current n/w architecture and why its better than other choices using some factual data.  
* The student explains their neural network parameters including the values selected and how these values were obtained (i.e. how was hyper tuning performed? Brute force, etc.) Hyper parameters include, but are not limited to: Epoch, Learning Rate, Batch Size. All configurable parameters should be explicitly stated and justified.
* The student demonstrates a clear understanding of 1 by 1 convolutions and where/when/how it should be used.
* The student demonstrates a clear understanding of a fully connected layer and where/when/how it should be used.
* The student is able to identify the use of various reasons for encoding / decoding images, when it should be used, why it is useful, and any problems that may arise.
* The student is able to clearly articulate whether this model and data would work well for following another object (dog, cat, car, etc.) instead of a human and if not, what changes would be required.

### Model Requirements
* The file is in the correct format (.h5) and runs without errors.
* The neural network should obtain an accuracy greater than or equal to 40% (0.40) using the Intersection over Union (IoU) metric.

### Submission Materials
* Model_training.ipynb notebook.
* A HTML version of your model_training.ipynb notebook.
* Writeup report (This file)
* Model and weights file in the .h5 file format
